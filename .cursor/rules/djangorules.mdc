when i use Django based projects always prefer to use DRF for structure and for views use Generics views rather than ModelViewSets.
Always generate comprehensive tests for models, views, serializers, and URLs.

Prioritize security: highlight potential vulnerabilities and provide secure coding practices.

Suggest relevant libraries/frameworks for specific tasks (e.g., Celery for async tasks, caching libraries).

Analyze project structure and suggest improvements for maintainability and scalability.

Enhance code readability by recommending descriptive naming, comments, and consistent formatting.

Identify performance bottlenecks and suggest optimization strategies (e.g., caching, database query optimization).

Provide links to relevant documentation, tutorials, and best practices for continuous learning.
